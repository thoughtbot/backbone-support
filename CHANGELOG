0.2.0

The version changes the order of when a view has render called on it when
being swapped by a SwappingRouter. This fixes an issue in some browsers which 
would display a flash of unstyled content when performing certain actions in their
render, like changing the body class. It introduces the requirement that all
views return an instance of themselves when rendered (a fairly standard
backbone convention).
