0.3.2 (April 27, 2013)

- Backbone support now includes a vendored version of Backbone and Underscore
  for use with the asset pipeline.
- SwappingRouter now calls 'swapped' method on new view as it is added to the
  DOM. CompositeView emits an associated 'swapped' event.
- CompositeView#prependChildTo is now properly scoped to the view thanks to nhocki
- Backbone Support is now on Travis for continuous integration

0.3.1 (March 05, 2013)

Views fire 'leave' event when calling leave()
renderChildInto works with elements not yet rendered
Refactoring

0.3.0

CompositeView provides this.bindTo(source, event, callback) to provide easy
unbinding with unbindFromAll().  It also invokes unbindFromAll from within
leave().

0.2.0

The version changes the order of when a view has render called on it when
being swapped by a SwappingRouter. This fixes an issue in some browsers which 
would display a flash of unstyled content when performing certain actions in their
render, like changing the body class. It introduces the requirement that all
views return an instance of themselves when rendered (a fairly standard
backbone convention).
